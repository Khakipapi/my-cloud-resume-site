                    <h3>2007-2008 military deployment</h3>
                    <p>
                        During my time in the Army, I was deployed to Afghanistan, where I served in various capacities that required adaptability and resilience. While not a squad leader at the time, I was responsible for critical tasks such as securing key locations, conducting patrols, and supporting mission objectives. This deployment taught me the importance of teamwork, discipline, and effective communication under pressure. These experiences have greatly contributed to my ability to handle challenging situations in my current role as a Cloud Engineer, where precision and reliability are essential.

                    <h3>Bjj Hobby</h3>
                    <p>In my free time, I am passionate about practicing Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu and Muay Thai. These martial arts disciplines not only keep me physically fit but also enhance my mental toughness and strategic thinking. Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu focuses on ground fighting and submission techniques, teaching me the importance of leverage, patience, and precision. Muay Thai, known as the "Art of Eight Limbs," emphasizes striking with fists, elbows, knees, and shins, fostering agility, coordination, and resilience. Both hobbies provide a balanced lifestyle and contribute to my personal growth, discipline, and problem-solving skills, which are invaluable in my professional life as a Cloud Engineer.</p>
